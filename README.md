## 1\. Introduction

LaTeX tables are implemented using TeX commands such as `\halign`, `\noalign`, `\span`, and `\omit`.
In order to implement new features, many macro packages have modified the inner table commands inside LaTeX.
This makes package code complicated, difficult to maintain, and often conflicts with each other.

At present, the LaTeX3 programming layer is basically mature.
This `tabularray` package will discard the old `\halign` commands and directly use LaTeX3 functions to parse the table,
and then typeset the entire table.
Under the premise of being compatible with the basic syntax of LaTeX2 tables,
this macro package will completely separate the contents and styles of the table,
and the styles of the table can be completely set in key-value way.
